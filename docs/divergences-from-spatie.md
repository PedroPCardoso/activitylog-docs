# Deliberate Divergences from Spatie Activitylog

Spatie's Laravel package is the functional inspiration, not a promise that TypeScript ORMs expose the same lifecycle hooks as Eloquent. These differences are deliberate and part of the public contract.

## ORM event coverage is explicit

Eloquent can observe model lifecycle events with rich original/current state. TypeORM and Prisma do not expose equivalent state for every write shape. Activitylog therefore publishes an adapter coverage matrix instead of claiming that one global hook sees everything.

For **TypeORM**, decorated `save`, `remove`, and `softRemove` lifecycle events are subscriber conveniences. Direct `Repository.update()` and update QueryBuilder calls are not treated as if they had a trustworthy old entity; `auditedUpdate()` is the explicit single-row, iff-committed alternative. Bulk writes require one Aggregate activity rather than an invented per-row diff.

For **Prisma**, `$extends` is explicitly best-effort: its old-value read, mutation and Activity write are not one atomic unit. `auditedTransaction()` supplies the iff-committed path by proxying the exact interactive transaction client. Bulk and configured nested writes become one Aggregate activity with a null subject id.

## Properties always use a stable diff envelope

Automatic entity changes store `properties.attributes` and `properties.old`. Creates have an empty `old`; hard deletes have empty `attributes`. This predictable envelope is used across ORM adapters instead of copying framework-specific change representations.

## Redaction is built in and enabled by default

Sensitive field names are deeply redacted before persistence. A `beforePersist` hook may enrich an Activity, but redaction runs afterward and remains the final guard. Disabling or replacing the default deny list must be explicit. Spatie does not have this.

## Identity is ORM-agnostic

Subjects and causers use an opaque type plus a string-compatible single primary key. Composite subject keys are outside the 0.x contract. This avoids coupling the core to ORM model instances or database-specific key types.

## Transactions are claimed only where they are controlled

The core accepts a transaction-bound executor but never starts or commits transactions itself. Adapters claim iff-committed only on explicit paths that control the entire mutation and Activity write, such as TypeORM `auditedUpdate()`. Convenience hooks remain documented with their payload and coverage limitations.
